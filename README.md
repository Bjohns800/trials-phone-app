# Trials Phone Scoring Application

This repo serves as a snapshot into the development of an application to be used on a mobile device in conjunction with another server application to add electronic live scoring to motorcycle trials.

This project is curently still in development.

The goal of this project is to be an open source solution that event organisers can use the applications to officiate thier local trials events.
